# spatial-transciptomics

## Day 1
### Background
- relies on barcodes to label exact sequence locations
- assign cell type to transcripts and then look at cell-cell interactions

### Visium
- Tissue capture area > each capture area have 5000 barcoded spots > each spot has millions of capture probes
- Doesn't give cellular resolution (like scRNA-seq) but does tell spatial context and transcriptome level (sequence everything)  

### Experimental procedures
- NGS barcoding ROI selection > quality control normalization > Cell-type deconvolution (pie chart chowing proporiton of each cell type in each spot) > downstream spatial analysis
