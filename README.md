# spatial-transciptomics

## Background
- relies on barcodes to label exact sequence locations
- assign cell type to transcripts and then look at cell-cell interactions

## Visium
- Tissue capture area > each capture area have 5000 barcoded spots > each spot has millions of capture probes 

## Experimental procedures
